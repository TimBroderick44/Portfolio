# Tim's Portfolio (AKA JavaScript-Free Zone)

Welcome to my personal portfolio! 

My name is Tim Broderick and I have recently started my software development journey with Nology, Australia. 
This is where I'll keep my projects and show off what I've been learning. 
Thanks for stopping by and having a look at my portfolio! I hope you enjoy it!  

## What did I use to create it? 

It utilises HTML & SASS to create an interactive display of my skills and achievements. 
[No JS was harmed in the production of this website - no JS was even used. As a challenge, and wanting to know more about CSS animations, I decided not to use any JS]

__Throughout creating this portfolio, here are some of the lessons I learnt:__

## CSS Animations and Transitions:

Over countless hours of experimentation, I learned how to create complex sequences that are engaging and entertaining while only using CSS.
I learned a lot about keyframes and transitions - there is a lot that CSS can do straight out of the box. 
It was really interesting having an idea in my head and trying to get it to work with no JS.  

## Flexbox & Positioning:

Flexbox is so much easier to use now. When I first starting learning about it, is was confusing and things ended up everywhere. I am now a lot more comfortable with it. I still have issues positioning things - who doesn't? - but I'm feeling more confident in my abilities now. In addition to Flexbox, I learnt more about relative and absolute positioning, utilizing the Z axis and (trying) to create effective and efficient media queries. 

## Thank You!
